# Visualization Live Prototype Files

### js directory

* `chart.js` - Primary point for front-end; appends most items, handles hovers, 'explore' button click event, and load events

* `worker.js` - Generates node positions using d3.force; largely unchanged from Bostock's [Force-Directed Web Worker](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/01ab2e85e8727d6529d20391c0fd9a16)

* `nodeClick.js` - Handles node click event UI updates (hidden network lines are shown, most direct path back to Dada is highlighted, card view on the left side is populated and interactive for multiple paths)

* `titleAnimation.js` - Unused, but optional feature that cycles through nodes (uses recursive 'setTimeout' function) to highlight on user landing. Performance drags / frame rate is suboptimal so left out of current build.

* `-min` suffix - Minified files generated by Codekit; not used in current build for better ease of debugging.

* `awesomeplete.js` - Local copy of the [Awesomplete search bar](http://leaverou.github.io/awesomplete/) used in the final build. Very light, fast and highly recommended over JQuery options.

### data directory

* `forceChart-d2fullSet.json` - Full dataset used in build. Other suffixes are legacy sets for testing purposes.

* `forceChart-sm.js` - Smaller dataset used for prototyping (to cut down on load time and test features).

### images directory

Various UI images.

### styles directory

* `awesomeplete.css` - Awesomplete's css. Required for functionality.

* `pres.css` - Presentation css. Not used in final build.

* `style.css` - Style css. Main styles.

* `toggler.css` - Toggle specific css for CSS3 animated toggle button. 

### presentation-pngs directory

Used in presentation mode.
